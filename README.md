# Hazard Detection and Alert System to Prevent Incidents

In this repo, you can find two Ardunio code files, one is BLE Server and other one is BLE Client.

**BLE Server**
<p>In this code we used BLE library and it acts as a server which sends two values they are RSSI and Distance.</p>

**Example**

You can check the bluetooth device ESP32 being listed in the scanned list, and connect to it.

**Conclusion**

Successfully, we were able to show the accurate position of the device in indoors.
Future work includes more thorough path loss to ensure accurate position of the device inside the buildings and having many obstacles.
